title: "Hosting on GitHub Pages"
---

You can use GitHub pages to host your website for free! Every time you push new content, your website will update within a few minutes!! There are different workflows available to this setup. In this workshop, we are opting to save the rendered html files to a `docs` folder, which is a naming convention that GitHub uses to point to content for GitHub pages.
