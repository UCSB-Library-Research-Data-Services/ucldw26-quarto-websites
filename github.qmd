title: "Hosting on GitHub Pages"
---

You can use GitHub pages to host your website for free! Every time you push new content, your website will update within a few minutes!! There are different workflows available to this setup. In this workshop, we are opting to save the rendered html files to a `docs` folder on our main branch, which is a naming convention that GitHub uses to point to content for GitHub pages.

## Render locally 

1. Create the `docs` subfolder in your project folder on your machine
1. In the `_quarto.yml` we need to specify we want to render content to this `docs` folder
```yaml
    project:
      type: website
      output-dir: docs
    
    website:
      title: "Publishing Quarto websites with GitHub pages"
      navbar:
        left:
          - href: index.qmd
            text: Intro
          - href: intro.qmd
            text: "Quarto Websites" 
          - href: github.qmd
            text: "Publish on GitHub"
          - href: customize.qmd
            text: "Do it in Style"
          - about.qmd
```
