This is a Quarto website.

## Structure of a Quarto document

![](img/quarto_doc_structure.png){fig-align="center"}

### 3 basic components:

-   Metadata (YAML aka Yet Another Markup Language)

-   Text for documentation ([markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) + other few tricks)

-   Code (chunks) with your analysis (R and friends)

## Structure of a Quarto website

For a website, each webpage is going to be its separate quarto document. To create a website, you need one extra YAML file that will stitch all those pages together. Enters: `_quarto.yml`

`_quarto.yml` can be seen as a config file that provides website options, such as style, name, navigation tools and more. Here is its content for this website:

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  title: "demo-website"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: quarto_intro.qmd
        text: "Introduction"
      - href: index.qmd
        text: "Quarto website"
      - href: quarto_slides.qmd
        text: "Slides"
      - href: quarto_paper.qmd
        text: "Paper"
      - href: quarto_interactive.qmd
        text: "Getting fancy"

format:
  html:
    theme:
      - cosmo
      - brand
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```

## So I can build a website that leverages R code!?

Yep!! And as with any other R script, it is good practice to start by loading the libraries you are going to need for your analysis / website content.

```{r}
library(httr2)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
```

Mmm... this is a lot of information we would like to hide.

### Take two

Adding an execution option: `#| warning: false` to the code chunk will let us hide the warning messages when rendering the document

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(httr2)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
```

Yeah!!!

## Now we can start coding!

Did somebody say cat?? Sorry **cute** cat?! You can insert an image using the markdown syntax: `![Fig caption](path/to/image)`

![A cat upside down](img/cat_upsidedown.jpg)

<br>

You can also customize alignment, size and more... add options with `{fig-align="right" width=50%}`

![A smaller cat upside down... on the right](img/cat_upsidedown.jpg){fig-align="right" width="50%"}

### We are going to use the [Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) to add random cats to our website

```{r}
req <- request("https://api.thecatapi.com/v1")
resp <- req %>%
  # Then we add on the images path
  req_url_path_append("images/search") %>%
  # Add query parameters _width and _quantity
  req_url_query(`limit` = 1) %>%
  req_perform() %>%
  resp_body_json()

knitr::include_graphics(resp[[1]]$url)
```

### We might want to hide the code

Of course there is an [option](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) for that: `#| echo: false`

```{r}
#| echo: false

req <- request("https://api.thecatapi.com/v1")
resp <- req %>%
  # Then we add on the images path
  req_url_path_append("images/search") %>%
  # Add query parameters _width and _quantity
  req_url_query(`limit` = 1) %>%
  req_perform() %>%
  resp_body_json()

knitr::include_graphics(resp[[1]]$url)
```

### Or collapse it

Try `#| code-fold: true` if you want to get fancy

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

req <- request("https://api.thecatapi.com/v1")
resp <- req %>%
  # Then we add on the images path
  req_url_path_append("images/search") %>%
  # Add query parameters _width and _quantity
  req_url_query(`limit` = 1) %>%
  req_perform() %>%
  resp_body_json()

knitr::include_graphics(resp[[1]]$url)
```

## Do it in style

### Themes

You can change the style of your website pretty easily using the 25 pre-defined [themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html) selected from the [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) project.

Let's try `flatly`. We need to update `_quarto.yml` so the bottom looks like this:

``` yaml
...

format:
  html:
    theme:
      - flatly  #cosmo
      - brand
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```
