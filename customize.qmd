## Customize your site

### Themes

You can change the style of your website pretty easily using the 25 pre-defined [themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html) selected from the [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) project.

Let's try `flatly`. We need to update `_quarto.yml` so the bottom looks like this:

``` yaml
...

format:
  html:
    theme:
      - flatly  #cosmo
      - brand
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```

### CSS

You also have other ways to customize further those default themes. For example you can use the Cascading Style Sheets or `CSS` to add specific rules to specific elements of your website. By default when you create a quarto website project in RStudio, it will create a file named `style.css` and add it to your styling options in `_quarto.yml`. This css file is empty by default. Let's add some content to modify our headers of level 2 to be green and have more space between letters

``` css
/* css styles */

h2 {
  color: orange;
  letter-spacing: 5px;
}
```

### **S**yntactically **A**wesome **S**tyle**s**heets (Sass)

Sass extends existing CSS features in a number of exciting ways, but importantly reduces repetition. You can use `.scss` stylesheet file(s) to define Sass variables to quickly customize your website’s theme. Sass variables are defined in the form `$var-name: value;`. Then you can use those variables to assign style to elements (that quarto has predefined). For example, let's make our navigation bar purple:

``` css
/*-- scss:defaults --*/

$purple: #800080;        /* define the variable purple as a color */
$navbar-bg: $purple;     /* use this variable to change navbar background */
```

And modify the `_quarto.yml` as follow:

``` yaml
...

format:
  html:
    theme:
      - cosmo  #flatly
      - styles.scss
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```
